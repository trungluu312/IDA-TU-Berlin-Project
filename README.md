# UNIVERSITY PROJECT
University Project

The goal is to work with a large database including large datasets to create a recall plan for faulty vehicles. 

Main work is focused on import and clean the data to create a final clean dataset to analyse. The 2nd part of the work focused on create a web app to visualize the analysis results to the stakeholders in a clear and easy-to-understand way.

This is a group work, members including: Jan Schulze, Jean Vincent Alexander Dunker, Tim Ferdinand Westhoff, Quoc Trung Luu. 

Noted: This was an university work, so the datasets are restricted to members only. Validibility and credibility are not proved.
